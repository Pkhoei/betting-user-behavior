# 🧠 User Behavior Analysis in Sports Betting Platform

This project explores user behavior patterns based on 100,000 sports betting records.  
It is inspired by real-world use cases such as **Norsk Rikstoto's responsible gaming mission**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on betting behavior and visualize patterns in user activity, stakes, and outcomes.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is an exploratory project focused on data understanding.  
> No machine learning models were applied in this version.
